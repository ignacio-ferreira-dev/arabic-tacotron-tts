Easy way:

To process words.xlsx:
first save it as a CSV file to words.csv, use a comma  (,) as delimiter 

Run the command 
python process_mp3.py --input_folder wordbywordaudio-main --out_folder training --csv words.csv


where wordbywordaudio-main is the folder containing the mp3s. 
This will run steps 1 - 3, generating a folder called training with the neccesary files to run the training process.


Flexible way, allowing for more complex dataflows 

1) Generate wav files from mp3
To generate wav files run the following command:
python mp3_to_wav.py --input_folder wordbywordaudio-main --out_folder  wordbywordaudio_wavs
where wordbywordaudio-main is the folder containing the mp3s
This process will run in 5 to 15 minutes on a SSD disk, it may take longer on a mechanical disk.

2) Process words file step
To process words.xlsx:
first export it as a CSV file, use a comma  (,) as delimiter 
then run the following command:
python process_words.py --input words.csv --output wordbywordaudio_wavs/temp_filtered.csv --wav wordbywordaudio_wavs

The command accepts the optional parameters  --text_column and --filename_column to set the names of the respective columns in the csv. They are set by default to 0 and 2 to process the current file structure.

Wav parameter is required to check for missing files. 

3)  Preprocess step
Run the command
python preprocess.py --input_dir wordbywordaudio_wavs  --output training --dataset nawar --num_workers 4

where num_workers is the number of cpu cores. This process will take about an hour and half on a quad core computer.
